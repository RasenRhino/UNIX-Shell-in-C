# UNIX-Shell-in-C
We have built a UNIX Shell in C which can perform all the built-functions. The `execvp()` function has been used for the same. To implement `cd` command `chdir()` in-built C function has been used. 

Additionally, there is a history feature and an execute most recent commands feature.
